These are some blogs I like, in no particular order.

- https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/ - Mostly content about possible improvements to the
  Rust programming language.
- https://without.boats/ - Also about improvements to Rust, mostly focused on async and error
  handling.
- https://faultlore.com/blah/ - Really in-depth explorations of unsafe Rust and related areas like
  the C ABI.
- https://drewdevault.com/ - Really high quality (and frequently controversial) takes on software
  freedom and culture.
- https://verdagon.dev/home - Explorations of crazy ways to make languages memory safe and the Vale
  programming language.
- https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne and https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/ - Newsletter and blog by
  the same guy. Mostly about formal methods, like TLA+ and Alloy. Insanely high rate of good takes.
- https://matklad.github.io/ - In-depth Rust and Zig content. Really good takes on testing and
  development workflow.
- https://blog.sunfishcode.online/ - Content about WASI and capabilities.
- https://nullprogram.com/ - Low level C programming and applications of arenas.
- https://thephd.dev - Really high quality explorations about how C and C++ could improve directly
  from the C ISO Standard editor.
- https://www.ralfj.de/blog/ - Explorations about the semantics of Rust. Really good resource on
  pointer provenance.
- https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/ - Content about HTMX, REST, and improving the HTML
  specification.
- https://justine.lol/ - Absurd sorcery to make programs that run unmodified in every operating
  system and even different architectures!
